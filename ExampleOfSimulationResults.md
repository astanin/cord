# Bipopulation model simulations #

In the bipopulation model there are two cell populations _ϕ_₁, and _ϕ_₂. The first cell line relies on complete glucose oxydation, and consumes both glucose and oxygen. The second cell line emerges from the first in hypoxic conditions, and relies on glycolysis to produce ATP, it consumes only glucose.

ATP production deficit (energy lack) manifests itself in different regions of the cord, for different populations. In fact, the starvation limit of the aerobic cells is closer to the vessel, while the starvation limit of the anaerobic cells is little bit farther. The region  between these two limits is where the glycolytic population has a clear advantage over normal one.
