# Basic model examples #

The basic model assumes that all the cells rely on complete glucose oxydation. Thus only one chemical may be considered: oxygen, _c_. State of the tissue is uniquely described by cellular volume fraction Ï• in this case.

The images below show simulation results for rectangular domain of the tissue. The contour delimits regions of tumour tissue (growing) in the left bottom corner and host tissue (quiescent). There is the source of oxygen (blood vessel) along x-axis (at the bottom of the image). Symmetry condition is assumed at the left border of the image.

## Oxygen distribution ##

Blueish tints show region with excessive oxygen concentration. Yellow and red tints show hypoxic regions.

## Cells' packing density distribution ##

Regions of denser tissue are darker.
